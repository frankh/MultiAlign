MultiAlign
==========

Alignment plugin for Sublime Text 2

The problem with existing alignment plugins is that they're all too specific.
They default to aligning around '=' or ',' or ':'.

This plugin is completely generic - it just aligns cursors.

Usage
=====

Simply add cursors to the points you want aligned (by ctrl+clicking, ctrl+d etc)
and run!

Default keybinding: <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>\\</kbd> (Linux+Windows) or <kbd>cmd</kbd>+<kbd>\</kbd> (OSX)
